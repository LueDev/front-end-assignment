In the terminal, run `npm install` to download the necessary node packages. 
Then run `npm start` and fill the form and submit. 
 
One thing to note is the phone number text field will only accept 10 numbers but says "Please match the requested format". I can update further upon request.
The other fields have a clearer error response.
